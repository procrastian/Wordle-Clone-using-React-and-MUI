# Creating a Wordle Clone

## Aims

- to have an app that allows a user to play the game `wordle` an unlimited amount of times
- have the app generate random 5 letter words each time it is played
- have the ability for the user to restart the game with a new word

- have the app display to the user:
  - 5 letter spaces to guess in
  - if a given letter is in an incorrect position in the word
  - if a given letter is in the correct position in the word
  - if a given letter is not in the word
  - which letters have been guessed by the user

- nice to haves:
  - the ability for the user to select harder difficulty with fewer than 6 guesses
  - how to play pop-up explaining the game at the start
  - have the app recognise key strokes for letters
  - dark mode/light mode
